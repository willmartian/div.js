# div.js
HTML, the web's most popular programming language, is bloated.

As of 2021, there are at least *10* HTML elements. Why? Why waste time use semantic when div do trick?

**Div.js** revolutionizes the web, meeting developers where they are at by focusing on their favorite element: `<div>`

## Usage

Simply add the `is` attribute to your divs to imbue them with free functionality, semantics, and accessibility.

```html
<div is="h1">Hello world!</div>
<div is="p">This is a <div is="b">bold</div> paragraph.</div>
<div is="ol">
  <div is="li">This is a list item.</div>
  <div is="li">This is a list item.</div>
  <div is="li">This is a list item.</div>
</div>
```

**Div.js** supports many handcrafted default element types. Find a full list [here.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)
